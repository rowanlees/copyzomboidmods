# copyzomboidmods
Provides a quick way for you to copy Project Zomboid mods from your steam workshop folder to your user Zomboid mods folder e.g. C:\Users\user\Zomboid\mods.

This is useful if you run Zomboid with the -nosteam launch option, which in itself is useful for hosting zomboid servers directly from the game with lower load times. When launched this way, mods are picked up from the C:\Users\user\Zomboid\mods folder rather than the Steam workshop folder.

You will have to tell the program where both the workshop folder and the user mods folder is. Usually you can find the workshop folder in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\108600' and the user mods folder in 'C:\Users\user\Zomboid\mods' (replace user with your username).
